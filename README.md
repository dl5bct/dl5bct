- This is Peter's @dl5bct repository.
- There eventually will be some ham radio / amateur radio stuff here. Don't expect anything great, nor working ;-)
- I still haven't gone past apprentice in most of the things, so please bear with me.
- There is, however, some acquaintance with FreeBSD.
- Please drop me an email dl5bct at gmx dot net if you want to be in touch -- but please be aware that I do take quite some time responding, at times... Sorry about that.
